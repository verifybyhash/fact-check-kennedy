## Participants
RFK Jr. - independent presidential candidate campaigning at the time of the interview. RFK has notably promoted conspiracy theories. 

## Claims:
RFK Jr.
- **I am beating Democratic and Republican candidates in polling**
  - [Timestamp](https://youtu.be/ZGRlNLNyUn4?t=805)
  - **Evidence:**
    - [Generation Lab Poll showing RFK Jr. in the lead](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2024-07-11/poll-rfk-jr-bests-trump-but-biden-suffers-more-in-a-wider-race)
    - [Many polls showing RFK Jr. never having had a lead](https://elections2024.thehill.com/national/harris-trump-rfk-general/)
  - **Determination:** **Indeterminable**
  - **Explanation:**
    - It's unclear whether there is a reliable source for RFK Jr.'s claim. One poll seems to support it, but its results are anomalous compared to most other polls.

- **Mainstream media will not give interviews; only had five such interviews.**
  - **Determination:** **Likely false**
  - **Evidence:**
    - [YouTube video of an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hisLKIGX6w)
    - [RFKâ€™s interview page listing more than five interviews](https://www.kennedy24.com/interviews)
  - **Explanation:**
    - RFK's own website lists more than five interviews on Fox News alone, surpassing the total he claimed.

  
- **After the 80s the news centers became profit centers, "and that's where we are today"**
  - **Determination** - **Likely false**
  - **Evidence**
    - [Revenue of newsrooms pew research](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/newspapers/) Graph "Estimated advertising and circulation revenue of the newspaper industry"
    - [News layoffs](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/us-news-industry-faces-bleak-start-to-2024.php)
  - **Explanation for determination**
    - Data shows that newsroom revenues have sharply declined since at least ~2010 - no indication of similar reduction of costs.

- **We're told the enemy is misinformation, but there's always been misinformation**
  - **Determination** - **Indeterminable**
  - **Explanation**
    - There's not one source that backs this up. It's reasonable that the amount of opportunities to spread information as well as the total classes of information have increased(AI-generated misinformation, etc.).

- **The people who are getting censored are the ones telling the truth**
  - **Determination** - **Indeterminable**
  - **Explanation**
    - RFK does not give a strong definition of censorship. He does not back up with examples. It's hard to know what he means or what examples he might be referring to.
     
  - A financial system based on blockchain may reduce costs due to lack of middlemen
    - Determination - **Indeterminable**
      - RFK cites the lack of middlemen in the financial system as a cost reduction which would prove that a blockchain based financial system would reduce costs and pass savings onto everyone. However, actual implementation of a blockchain system into an adopted financial system is a completely unknown implementation and may come with unknown-sized costs.

- **1200 new cryptocurrencies founded in the past few years**
  - **Determination** - **Indeterminable**
  - **Evidence**
    - [Cryptocurrencies in Switzerland - statista](https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/digital-assets/cryptocurrencies/switzerland)
  - **Explanation**
    - I could not find a source which supported this claim. Other sources state that the U.S. receives higher revenue from crypto than switzerland.
   
- **Current candidates ran up 8 trillion dollars each in debt**
  - **Determination** - **Likely false***
  - **Evidence**
    - [Biden and Trump debt - Committee for a Responsible Budget](https://www.crfb.org/papers/trump-and-biden-national-debt)
  - **Explanation**
  -   RFK jr.s count of Biden's debt seems off by four trillion.

**Hoskinson**
- **According to Justice Gorsuch, people commit a least one felony a day.**
  - **Determination** - **Likely true**
  - **Explanation**
    - This seems to be fairly accurate to a quote by Justice Gorsuch which suggests that average busy people may inadverdently commit several federal crimes per day.
  - **Evidence**

## Opinons/Argument
- The real misinformation issue is the government control of information
- Make US a center of key new technologies such as blockchain, AI, quantum computing in order to raise GDP and fight deficit.
- Charles suggests that RFK jr. represents his crowd at the convention.
